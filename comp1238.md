## Week 1 - Before computers
- Writing originally developed in the Fertile Cresent in Mesapotamia as Cuneiform around 5,000 years ago. It was first used for financial record-keeping (such as for beer and grain) but then expanded to poetry and epics.
- Literacy was spurred on by developments over time, such as woodblock printing, movable type, and the typewriter. In fact, we inherit many concepts, such as monospaced/proportional fonts and carriage return from these inventions.
- There are different number systems, such as Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal, that use different bases (2, 8, and 16 respectively).
## Week 2 - Representing text and numbers
- Data can be represented in the form of bytes, which are represented by eight bits.
- ASCII, Extended ASCII, and Unicode can be used to represent characters by assigning them numbers.
- Text-mode divides the screen into a character grid, where each pixel would be drawn by low-level hardware and not directly processed by the computer.
## Week 3 - Markup languages
- Text has a structure consisting of whitespaces, indentation, and newlines.
- Characters can be split into alphanumeric (A-Z; 0-9) or non-alphanumeric ([]\\;',./) characters.
- Markup languages, such as HTML and MD, can be used to display text, rather than process or interpret them.
## Week 4 - Keyboards and editors
- Keyboards can be sold in other form factors, such as ortho-linear and split. Layouts can either differ physically, visually, or logically. Layouts are usually named after the top-left row (e.g. QWERTY, DVORAK, AZERTY), and can have language-specific variants.
- Text editors focus on plaintext, while word processors focus on formatted text.
- IDEs include an editor and many other tools (such as an integrated compiler), and are language specific. Text-mode editors primarily work on the command line, and rely on the keyboard only (e.g. Vi and Emacs).
## Week 5 - CLI
- Batch mode was an old way of interfacing with computers, which required two people to use. The *programmer* prepared the program while the *operator* converted the code into punched cards and ran it on the mainframe.
- Interactive terminals only needed a programmer, and consisted of a keyboard connected to a mainframe which outputted via a printer. Later on, video terminals eliminated the printer and allowed real-time monitoring of input and output.
- CLI is the general idea of using text-based human-computer interaction, Interfacing is the act of typing in a terminal and getting a response, and Terminal is a black window that allows you to input the commands.
